# Building Multiple Linear Regression Models for Customer Loyalty

## Project Overview
This project focuses on building multiple linear regression models to identify key factors influencing customer loyalty for a retail consumer goods company. Using an extensive customer loyalty dataset, the project aims to reveal relationships between loyalty and potential influencing factors such as product quality, price fairness, brand trust, community outreach efforts, and negative publicity.

## Key Skills and Techniques
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Utilised histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps to identify distributions and relationships within the dataset.
- **Regression Analysis:** Developed a multiple linear regression model using key variables that showed strong correlations with customer loyalty.
- **Model Evaluation:** Calculated $R^2$, adjusted $R^2$, and residual sum of squares (RSS) to assess the model's explanatory power and error.
- **Feature Selection:** Identified key predictors, including price fairness, quality, trust, and customer satisfaction, to optimise model performance.
- **Libraries:** `pandas`, `numpy`, `seaborn`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn`.

## Results & Recommendations
- **Model Performance:** The final multiple linear regression model achieved an $R^2$ score of approximately 0.71, indicating that 71% of the variance in customer loyalty could be explained by the selected predictors.
- **Key Drivers of Loyalty:** Quality and customer satisfaction were identified as significant drivers of customer loyalty, suggesting that enhancing product quality and customer experience could positively influence loyalty.
- **Strategic Recommendations:**
  1. **Focus on Quality and Trust:** Enhance initiatives that directly boost perceived quality and trust, as these have strong correlations with loyalty.
  2. **Dynamic Pricing Strategies:** Implement dynamic pricing strategies to reflect customer perceptions and market conditions, given the impact of price fairness on loyalty.
  3. **Continuous Monitoring:** Monitor customer feedback and iterate on product offerings and marketing strategies, focusing on the key predictors of loyalty.
